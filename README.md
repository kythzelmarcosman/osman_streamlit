The ass.py script sets up a basic Streamlit web app that gathers user details through a form. It collects inputs like full name, email, contact number, age, and a 4-digit PIN. After the user submits the form, their information is displayed, with the PIN obscured to maintain privacy. The app offers a simple and user-friendly method for securely collecting data.

The ass1.py application is a Streamlit-based tool for data analysis that lets users upload CSV files, view their contents, filter the data via a sidebar, and generate histograms for numerical columns. It provides a straightforward interface for users to explore and manipulate datasets visually, and they can also download the filtered data as a CSV file.

The ass2.py code presents an educational Streamlit app focused on Data Warehousing and Enterprise Data Management (EDM). Users can navigate through topics like ETL workflows, data integration, governance, and modeling using a sidebar menu. The app includes informative tabs, a checklist for data warehouse implementation, and links to useful learning materials, serving as a helpful study guide.

The ass3.py script creates a COVID-19 analytics dashboard using Streamlit and the Disease.sh API. It offers recent statistics for selected countries over the last 30 days, showing trends in new cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases. The app features visual elements like line graphs and pie charts, allows users to inspect raw data, and calculates a recovery-to-death ratio for additional insight into each country's health situation.

The ass4.py app provides a database dashboard for managing hospital records using a Streamlit interface connected to a MySQL database named "hospital." Through a login form on the sidebar, users can authenticate and, once logged in, view, filter, and insert data into doctor or patient tables. It uses SQLAlchemy for managing database operations and leverages caching to enhance performance.

The ass5.py project is a Streamlit-powered live video processing tool that accesses your webcam feed. Users can apply various visual effects such as grayscale, blur, edge detection, brightness adjustment, and sepia filters. They can also capture and save snapshots with timestamps and control the video feed, with all image processing handled via OpenCV.
